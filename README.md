# Application-in-a-Container

### We use docker when:
- we want to make an application portable,
- sharing app with someone else so that someone can run it on its local machine,
- app deployment on cloud's server.

### Deckerizing an application
1. Preparing DockerFile that contains set of instructions.
2. Building Docker Image.
3. Any missing elements are downloaded (pulled) form Docker registry.
4. Running many Docker containers based on built Docker image.
